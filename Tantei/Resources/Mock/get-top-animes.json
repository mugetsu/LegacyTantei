            "synopsis": "Was it all just a coincidence, or was it inevitable? Ichigo Kurosaki gained the powers of a Soul Reaper through a chance encounter. As a Substitute Soul Reaper, Ichigo became caught in the turmoil of the Soul Society, a place where deceased souls gather. But with help from his friends, Ichigo overcame every challenge to become even stronger. When new Soul Reapers and a new enemy appear in his hometown of Karakura, Ichigo jumps back into the battlefield with his Zanpakuto to help those in need. Meanwhile, the Soul Society is observing a sudden surge in the number of Hollows being destroyed in the World of the Living. They also receive separate reports of residents in the Rukon District having gone missing. Finally, the Seireitei, home of the Soul Reapers, comes under attack by a group calling themselves the Wandenreich. Led by Yhwach, the father of all Quincies, the Wandenreich declare war against the Soul Reapers with the following message: \"Five days from now, the Soul Society will be annihilated by the Wandenreich.\" The history and truth kept hidden by the Soul Reapers for a thousand long years is finally brought to light. All things must come to an end as Ichigo Kurosaki's final battle begins! (Source: official site, translated)",

This is a far cry from reality, however, as Denji is forced by the yakuza into killing devils in order to pay off his crushing debts. Using his pet devil Pochita as a weapon, he is ready to do anything for a bit of cash. Unfortunately, he has outlived his usefulness and is murdered by a devil in contract with the yakuza. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Pochita merges with Denji's dead body and grants him the powers of a chainsaw devil. Now able to transform parts of his body into chainsaws, a revived Denji uses his new abilities to quickly and brutally dispatch his enemies. Catching the eye of the official devil hunters who arrive at the scene, he is offered work at the Public Safety Bureau as one of them. Now with the means to face even the toughest of enemies, Denji will stop at nothing to achieve his simple teenage dreams. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis": "Gol D. Roger was known as the \"Pirate King,\" the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King. Enter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece.

Believing that Japan has lacked an egoistic striker hungry for goals, Jinpachi initiates the Blue Lock—a prison-like facility where three hundred talented strikers from high schools all over Japan are isolated and pitted against each other. The sole survivor of Blue Lock will earn the right to become the national team's striker, and those who are defeated shall be banned from joining the team forever. Selected to join this risky project is Yoichi Isagi, a striker who failed to bring his high school soccer team to the national tournament. After choosing to pass to a teammate who missed instead of scoring on his own, he could not help but wonder if the results would have been different had he been more selfish. Using this golden opportunity given by the Blue Lock Project, Yoichi aims to clear his doubts and chase his ultimate desire—to become the greatest striker in the world and lead Japan to World Cup glory.

            "synopsis": "Shinichi Kudou, a high school student of astounding talent in detective work, is well known for having solved several challenging cases. One day, when Shinichi spots two suspicious men and decides to follow them, he inadvertently becomes witness to a disturbing illegal activity. Unfortunately, he is caught in the act, so the men dose him with an experimental drug formulated by their criminal organization, leaving him to his death. However, to his own astonishment, Shinichi lives to see another day, but now in the body of a seven-year-old child. Perfectly preserving his original intelligence, he hides his real identity from everyone, including his childhood friend Ran Mouri and her father, private detective Kogorou Mouri. To this end, he takes on the alias of Conan Edogawa, inspired by the mystery writers Arthur Conan Doyle and Ranpo Edogawa. Detective Conan follows Shinichi who, as Conan, starts secretly solving the senior Mouri's cases from behind the scenes with his still exceptional sleuthing skills, while covertly investigating the organization responsible for his current state, hoping to reverse the drug's effects someday.

When he finally regains consciousness, Ojisan begins to ramble in a foreign tongue and reveals that he had been transported to a magical world called Gran Bahamal. Takafumi dismisses his uncle's claims as nonsense until an incantation makes a cup of water hover in the air. In a flash of brilliance, the pair creates a YouTube channel to showcase Ojisan's magical abilities. The responsibility now falls on Takafumi's shoulders to acquaint Ojisan with everything that has transpired during his absence, including getting him up to speed with the internet, new technology, and surprisingly, the outcome of the '90s console war—the result of which was especially distressing for a hardcore SEGA fan. With Ojisan's wisdom from his other world experiences, they grow their YouTube channel and tackle online comments and trolls. The journey of this uncle-nephew duo promises to be anything but conventional. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Meanwhile, the Free Planets Alliance is experiencing a declining phase, its national power weakened significantly due to widespread government corruption, despite military success has been achieved on the battlefields. As the balance of power between the two super states dominating the Galaxy is clearly undergoing a major shift, Adrian Rubinsky, the Landesherr of the autonomous and nominally neutral dominion of Fezzan, sees an opportunity to take advantage from the situation.

The five-year-old is a cut above the most troublesome, perverted, and shameless kid one can imagine. Shin-chan is almost always engaged in questionable activities such as forgetting about a friend during hide and seek, sumo wrestling for love, performing various gags including the notorious \"elephant\" in public, and flirting with college girls. The exemplary troublemaker has done it all and has no plans to stop anytime soon. Crayon Shin-chan follows the daily shenanigans of Shin-chan with his group of friends, parading around as the self-proclaimed \"Kasukabe Defense Force.\" The adults witnessing these shenanigans unfold can't help but adore Shin-chan, as he keeps them entertained while unintentionally solving their daily troubles through his mindless antics—leaving himself as the only problem they do not know what to do with. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
            "background": "The first English dubbed version was produced with many famous voice actors through 2001–2002 by Vitello Productions. In 2004, Phuuz Entertainment produced a continuation of the Vitello dub with different Los Angeles-based voice actors. The Phuuz and Vitello dub aired in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Republic of Ireland, and translations of these dubs aired in Europe and Latin America. The dubs were close to the original but had seen some censorship. The English dubbed version by Funimation was produced in 2005, featuring a Texas-based cast of voice actors, and was altered in comparison to the original—sexual references, dark humor, and references to popular American culture were added later on. Additionally, many non-existent backstories and different personalities were created. Crayon Shin-chan has also been adapted into video games, mobile games and tons of anime movies.",

He longs to become the true mastermind behind it all, pulling the strings, and having his machinations drive the entire story. In his previous life in modern-day Japan, he was not able to achieve his goals. But now, reborn into a world of magic, he will show the true eminence of shadow! As Cid pretends to be just another average mob character, he recruits members to his (fake) organization Shadow Garden, aiming to take down the mysterious cult who lurks in the shadows. With plenty of ad-libs, Cid leads his (fake) organization against the foul (yet surprisingly real) Diabolos Cult. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Soon, they learn their purpose: as the prison guard, Es must delve into the psyches of 10 inmates, each of them imprisoned for causing the loss of life in some form or another. Their fates rest in Es' hands. Do the means justify an end, and how much does intent matter if the result is death? No matter how the lines between good and evil, right and wrong, and just and cruel are blurred, there are only two options Es can choose between: innocent or guilty. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With no friends, no family, and no home to return to, Guts is a lonely swordsman who travels around as a mercenary in a land shaken by the Hundred Years War. Guts is able to handle a sword longer than he is tall and easily defeats powerful enemies. Griffith, the leader of the mercenary group \"Band of the Hawk,\" has his eye on Guts. Griffith, who has a commanding power unimaginable from his beautiful appearance and great ambitions, wins Guts in a duel and brings him into the Band of the Hawk to fulfill his own dream. As they go through numerous fierce battles together, their friends become bound by trust. The bond between Griffith and Guts, in particular, has become something special. Eventually, the Band of the Hawk rose to become the regular army of the Kingdom of Midland, but this was only the first step in Griffith's quest to reach the top. Guts, on the other hand, is taken in by Griffith's \"dream\" and begins to question his life of just wielding a sword. But what Guts doesn't know yet is the terrible fate that their endless dreams have bestowed upon them...",
